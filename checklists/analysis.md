# Analysis Checklist (Generic)

- Identify dispatcher/router via strings and xrefs
- Label handlers and utilities; map 2–3 hop call chains
- Locate security-relevant sinks (FS, exec, DB, network)
- For each path from handler→sink, note controls present and order
- Record gaps relative to the CWE guide for this pattern
